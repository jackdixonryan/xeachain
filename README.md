Successful contract completion of course.
Test number one: 
1 job
is taken by 1 player

Seconds are translated into XECs per second (XPS)
XECS are progressively added to user balance on per second basis. 
amt. of time remaining on job dwindles respectively
on amt. of time remaining on job running out, job is marked complete. 
Simple, right?
